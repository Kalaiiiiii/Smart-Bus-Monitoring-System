# 🚌 Smart Bus Monitoring System

A real-time IoT-based bus tracking system that displays live bus location and passenger count using GPS, ESP8266, Firebase, and a web interface.

## 🚀 Features

- 📍 Real-time location tracking of multiple buses on a web map (OpenStreetMap)
- 🧮 Live passenger count using IR sensors
- 🔄 Continuous data updates via Firebase
- 🧭 Route and bus information shown through a user-friendly web interface
- 💡 Low-cost, scalable architecture using ESP8266 microcontrollers

## 🔧 Hardware Used

- ESP8266 (NodeMCU)
- GPS Module (e.g., NEO-6M V2)
- IR Sensors (for passenger counting)
- JHD162A LCD with I2C module
- Power supply modules, jumper wires, etc.

## 💻 Software & Tools

- Arduino IDE (for embedded programming)
- Firebase Realtime Database (for storing GPS + passenger data)
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript (for web interface)
- OpenStreetMap (for rendering map)
- VS Code (for web development)

⚠️ Firebase credentials are not included. You must create your own Firebase project and set up your Realtime Database with secure rules.
